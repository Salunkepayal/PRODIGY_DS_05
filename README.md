# PRODIGY_DS_05
I analyzed traffic accidents for Prodigy InfoTech using a Python script. The script generates synthetic data for road and weather conditions, time, locations, and severity of accidents, and visualizes distributions and hotspots. 

Task 05: Traffic Accident Analysis
This Python script, part of my Prodigy InfoTech internship, analyzes synthetic traffic accident data. It generates data for road conditions, weather, time of day, accident locations, and severity. Using pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and scikit-learn, the script:

Explores road and weather distributions
Identifies accident hotspots
Analyzes accidents by hour
Studies the impact of road conditions on severity

Usage:

Clone the repository.
Install the required libraries.
Run traffic_accident_analysis.py. (Task05.ipynb)
Explore insights on traffic accidents.
Note: This script uses synthetic data for demonstration purposes. Replace the synthetic data generation with your real-world data source for actual analysis.
